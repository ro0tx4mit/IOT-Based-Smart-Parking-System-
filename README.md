Title: IoT-Based Smart Parking System Using Arduino

Introduction
The IoT-based car parking management system is an innovative solution designed to optimize the utilization of parking spaces and enhance the overall parking experience. This report presents the development of a smart parking system using Arduino and various components. The system incorporates IoT technology to monitor and manage parking spaces in real-time, providing users with accurate information on parking availability.

System Architecture
The smart parking system consists of three main components: parking sensors, Arduino board, and a central server. The architecture diagram below illustrates the interaction between these components.

         +--------------+-------+------+--------------+
Hardware Components
The following hardware components are used in the smart parking system:
Arduino Uno board: It acts as the main controller and is responsible for data processing and communication with the central server.
Ultrasonic sensors: These sensors are used to detect the presence of vehicles in parking spaces. They measure the distance between the sensor and the vehicle, enabling accurate occupancy detection.
LED indicators: LEDs are used to display the availability status of parking spaces, indicating whether a space is vacant (green) or occupied (red).
System Functionality
The smart parking system operates as follows:
The ultrasonic sensors are installed at each parking space to detect the presence of vehicles. They continuously measure the distance between the sensor and the vehicle.
The Arduino board collects the sensor data and analyzes it to determine the occupancy status of each parking space.
The Arduino board communicates with the central server, providing real-time updates on parking space availability.
The central server stores and processes the data received from the Arduino board, maintaining a record of the parking occupancy status.
Users can access the central server through a web or mobile application to check the availability of parking spaces in real-time.

Conclusion
The IoT-based smart parking system developed using Arduino and various components offers an efficient solution for managing parking spaces. By providing real-time information on parking availability, the system enables users to find vacant parking spaces quickly, reducing congestion and improving overall parking efficiency. With further enhancements and integration with mobile applications, this system can revolutionize the way parking is managed in urban areas.
Please note that this report provides a high-level overview of the smart parking system and the Arduino code snippet. Detailed implementation steps, additional features, and integration with specific IoT platforms or applications may require further development and customization.
